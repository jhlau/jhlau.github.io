My field of research is in Natural Language Processing (NLP) &mdash; a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence &mdash; and the goal of NLP is to develop computational models to understand human languages. There are a host of NLP applications that are commonly used in our everyday lives: machine translation (e.g. Google Translate) and chatbot (e.g. Siri) are two examples. My research is characterised by a diverse flavour of applications, but they are connected by my passion for language modelling, such as [discovering topics from document collections](https://aclanthology.org/E14-1056.pdf), [understanding the nature of grammar knowledge](https://github.com/jhlau/jhlau.github.io/raw/master/files/2017-cogsci-grammaticality.pdf), [analysing the conversation dynamics of online misinformation](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.364.pdf), and generating [poetry](https://aclanthology.org/P18-1181.pdf) or [stories](https://aclanthology.org/2023.inlg-main.23.pdf). Some of my research has a broader community interest beyond academia &mdash; e.g. my work in text generation and influence operations has been covered by science magazines (New Scientist) and mainstream news media (Guardian and BBC).

### Prospective Students

- If your query is related PhD supervision, it would help to: (1) have a look over my publications to identify areas of overlapping interests; and (2) send a thoughtful research proposal to suggest potential projects. As a student I don't expect that you have a perfect understanding of the gaps in the field and can identify research questions that fit the scope of a PhD, but the proposal would serve to kickstart a discussion about potential project ideas.
- If your query is about internship, please note that I do not take interns (and so any queries of this nature would not receive a response).
