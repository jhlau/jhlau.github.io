My research is in the intersection of machine learning and language, and my vision is to explore machine learning models to better understand language. I have a particular interest in language generation &mdash; tasks that require the machine to produce language, e.g. summarisation and story generation &mdash;  and unsupervised learning &mdash; learning where supervision signal is not available.

Prior to joining the University of Melbourne, I spent over 3.5 years as an industry scientist at IBM Research, developing solutions for clients in application domains from education to government. In parallel to this I was committed to research and actively collaborated with universities around the world, and in recognition of my scientific achievements  I was awarded a science accomplishment prize in 2019.
